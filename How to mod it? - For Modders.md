# How to mod it? - A Simple Guide for Modders Using hooh's Modding Tools
Since there is so far no such a plugin in HS2/AIS Chara Maker Mode to edit bodymask, it still needs modders to add bodymask in their modding process.

This text simply introduces how to add bodymask by using hooh Modding Tools. In addition, I won't in this text to elaborate everything, and I suppose that you have already known the basic knowledge on hooh's Modding Tool, at least for modding studio items. For newbie modder who would like to learn hooh's Modding Tools from scratch to  mod for HS2 or AI-Shoujo, please check hooh's guide (https://hooh-hooah.github.io/#/README), or my more detailed tutorials (https://www.blatke.cc/index.html#tutorials).
